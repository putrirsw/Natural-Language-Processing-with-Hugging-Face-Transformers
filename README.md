# Natural Language Processing with Hugging Face Transformers

## Author : Cognitive Class AI

This Guided Project will walk you through some of the applications of Hugging Face Transformers in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Hugging Face Transformers provide pre-trained models for a variety of applications in NLP and Computer Vision. For example, these models are widely used in near real-time translation tasks, opening communication spaces to language-diverse and hearing-impaired audiences. In this project, you will learn and practice applying these models to do text summarization, sentiment classification, translation, generate new text, and extract information from text.

  - perform text classification, such as sentiment analysis
  - perform topic classification  
  - generate some text 
  - perform token classification, such as Name Entity Recognition (NER)
  - extract some information by doing question answering analysis
  - do text summarization
  - translate text from one language to another
